# Surge - Custom Leap Motion Gestures

## Experiment

Surge is a library for creating your own custom gestures for the Leap Motion controller. This is an experiment to see how to improve the gestures that the Leap Motion controller can recognize, and make it easy to react to gestures in your JavaScript application.

## Development

- Run `guard`
- Mess with the files in `./source`
- Open `index.html`
